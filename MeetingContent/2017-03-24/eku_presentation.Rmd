## What is a Shiny Application

A Browser based application that allows the user to submit input to the R session.

The application hosts a collection of objects that produce

* side effects
* values


## Reactivity

The key feature of the shiny appliation is that the components can be **reactive**. That is, the components on the UI will react to what the user
does.

## Inputs and Outputs

* User inputs are stored in the `input` list
* UI components to show the user are stored in the `output` list

inputs and outputs may be manipulated on the server.

The user interface source code should remain somewhat static.

## Managing Reactivity

* Use `observe` for side effects
* Use `reactive` for outputs

functions that render UI components are a type of `reactive`

Try to think of `reactive` definitions as recipes.
