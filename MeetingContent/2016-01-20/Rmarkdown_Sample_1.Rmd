This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

An Rmarkdown file consists of three types of blocks. These are

1. The YAML header (Yet Another Markup Language)
2. Markdown (Document text)
3. Code chunks

It is used to apply settings that set up the appearance and format of the document. 

## Markdown

Markdown provides the narrative part of the document.

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. [Wikipedia reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

For the most part, your markdown will probably look like text you might type into a word processor. You can still designate _italic_ and **bold** text, as well as including links, images, tables, etc using a plain text syntax that can be rendered into multiple formats.

## Code Chunks

R Code chunks can be included in an Rmarkdown document by designating the chunk with backticks.  The first set of backticks has an options block `{r, [...]}` appended to it.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
mean(rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1))
```
